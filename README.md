## Use homeopathic principles to protect your computer from viruses and worms!

Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating the individual with highly diluted substances, with the aim of triggering the body’s natural system of healing. Now you can use the same principle for your computer security needs!

### Like with like

Homeopathy is based on the principle that you can treat ‘like with like’, that is, a substance which causes symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to treat those same symptoms. Substances are used in ultra high dilutions, which makes them non-toxic.

Homeopathic medicines (which homeopaths call remedies) are prepared by specialist pharmacies using a careful process of dilution and succussion (a specific form of vigorous shaking).

By diluting and succussing for example a computer virus' source code, we can use homeopathy to create highly potent computer security applications.

### Usage:

The command `./potentise.sh substances/some_virus_source.foo 200`
will generate a C200 solution as a small .txt file. Put anywhere on your hard disk, this file will protect you not only of the specific virus, but also of similar types of attacks.

### Examples:

This repo provides you with just a few examples of initial substances in the form of source code. We suggest the following substance bases for certain applications:
