## Use homeopathic principles to protect your computer from viruses and worms!

[Homeopathy](https://www.psiram.com/en/index.php/Homeopathy) is a system of medicine which involves treating the individual with highly diluted substances, with the aim of triggering the body’s natural system of healing. Now you can use the same principle for your computer security needs!

### Like with like

Homeopathy is based on the principle that you can treat ‘like with like’, that is, a substance which causes symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to treat those same symptoms. Substances are used in ultra high dilutions, which makes them non-toxic.

Homeopathic medicines (which homeopaths call remedies) are prepared by specialist pharmacies using a careful process of dilution and succussion (a specific form of vigorous shaking).

But the [memory effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory) of water – it's ability to retain a memory of substances previously dissolved – can also be observed in **semiconductor memory!** By diluting and succussing for example a computer virus' source code, we can use homeopathy to create highly potent computer security applications.

### Usage:

The command `./potentise.sh substances/<some_virus.source> 20`
will generate a C20 solution as a small .txt file. Put anywhere on your hard disk, this file will protect you not only of the specific virus, but also of similar types of attacks.

### Examples:

This repo provides you with a powerful example of an initial substance in the form of [Michelangelo's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_%28computer_virus%29) source code. A simple `./potentise.sh substances/michelangelo.asm 20` will create a powerful `solution.txt` against many forms of boot sector and partition table infectors. But the power of homeopathy doesn't end with viruses and worms. Diluting and potentising specific source files can yield many beneficial results.
